Goku sets off to recruit teammates. After Vegeta refuses, Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu, who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7. Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan. Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic. Back at Grand Zenō's and Future Grand Zenō's palace, all the gods from all 12 universes gather. The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match. He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament. In the first round, Majin Buu is to fight Basil, a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9. ",2/12/2017,,,5,5
79,Universe 9s Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7s Majin Buu!!,30,"Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh, the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender  says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match. Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender. ",2/19/2017,,,5,5
80,Awaken Your Sleeping Battle Spirit! Gohans Fight!!,30,"As their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he cannot continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well. However, Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong. Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had long believed that there were too many universes. He was planning to erase most of them anyway, but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared. With the announcement concluded, the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo, Basil's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine. ",2/26/2017,,,5,5

Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō agree on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle. Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō will immediately erase all of the universes. Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms. When the fight begins, Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed. Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times, but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku's attacks. He grows stronger and physically larger. Goku continues to attack, which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight. Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue, which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha. Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure, but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge. The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin. The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner. Suddenly, a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo appears and challenges Goku to a battle.

Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience. They proceed to ask Vegeta, who has been thinking of a name for his second child. Vegeta refuses to participate. He says he will not fight, while Bulma is pregnant. Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight. Everyone celebrates the baby's birth. Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother. As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta, he develops an attachment to her. Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot.

They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan, where Krillin's strategies make up for the gap in power, forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan. Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form, and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash. As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin, No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku's Kamehameha, just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion. She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku cannot expect to fight one-on-one all the time.

Gohan develops a strategy that has Frieza use his energy to form a cage around Dyspo, which prevents him from using his high-speed attacks and allows Gohan to gain the upper hand. Unfortunately, Frieza runs out of energy, and the cage dissolves before Gohan can land the finishing blow. However, Gohan is able to grab Dyspo and hold him in place, while Frieza launches a blast that knocks them off the fighting stage and eliminates them both from the tournament. ",1/21/2018,,,5,5
125,With Imposing Presence! God of Destruction Toppo Descends!!,30,"Goku and Vegeta continue their battle with Jiren, while No. 17 and Toppo fight. No. 17 and Toppo engage in a beam clash, which Toppo is winning. Frieza intervenes and strikes Toppo repeatedly from behind, which allows No. 17 to overpower Toppo's blast. In the wake of the explosion, Toppo appears to have been defeated. However, he gets back up and powers up, using the same type of energy as a God of Destruction. Belmod explains that Toppo is a candidate to be Universe 11's next God of Destruction, which is why he can wield the same kind of power. Toppo unleashes his new power, which damages the fighting stage and breaks a large portion of it. No. 17 and Frieza attack Toppo repeatedly, but his power is now far superior to theirs. Toppo easily defeats them both. Fortunately, they are able to stay on the fighting stage, but Toppo knocks Frieza unconscious and engages in another beam clash with No. 17. ",1/28/2018,,,5,5
126,Surpass Even a God! Vegetas Desperate Blow!!,30,"Toppo easily overpowers No. 17's blast. No. 17 is able to evade him for a while by using the broken fighting stage to his advantage, but Toppo effortlessly withstands No. 17's attacks. Toppo prepares to eliminate No. 17 with a giant energy blast. Frieza rejoins the battle and deflects Toppo's attack. Frieza uses his own energy attack to immobilize Toppo, which allows him and No. 17 to land numerous attacks, but none of them have any effect. Toppo is about to eliminate them both, when he is interrupted by Goku and Vegeta, who are still fighting Jiren. Frieza and No. 17 are hit by one of Jiren's attacks, which gives Toppo the opportunity to attack Vegeta instead. Toppo overwhelms Vegeta with his new power and states that he has cast aside everything else in order to become strong enough to win the tournament. However, Vegeta is inspired by his family, his promise to Cabba, and his Saiyan pride. He refuses to cast anything aside. Vegeta unleashes his full power and overwhelms Toppo. Vegeta and Toppo both use their ultimate attacks: Toppo unleashes his Energy of Destruction, while Vegeta uses the Final Explosion technique that he used against Majin Buu. Vegeta's attack overwhelms Toppo's attack, blasts Toppo out of the fighting stage, and eliminates him from the tournament. This also causes even more damage to the fighting stage. Due to Vegeta being much stronger than the last time he used the Final Explosion technique, he survives the blast, but his energy is almost completely drained. No. 17 also reappears, but he has been injured by Jiren's attack. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all face off against Jiren, who begins to unleash his full power. ",2/4/2018,,,5,5
127,The Approaching Wall! The Final Barrier of Hope!!,30,"Jiren powers up to his maximum. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all attack him simultaneously, but he easily overpowers them. However, No. 17 manages to land a sneak attack and injures Jiren. Jiren defeats Goku and Vegeta, while Frieza rejoins the fight and tries to kill Jiren in his golden form. However, Frieza is easily defeated as well. No. 17 asks Jiren what his wish on the Super Dragon Balls would be, and Belmod explains that Jiren's endless pursuit of strength was inspired when his parents, most of his comrades, and mentor were killed by a powerful villain. However, his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship, and he now focuses solely on increasing his own strength. No. 17 admires Jiren's human qualities, but he accuses Jiren of using the rest of his universe's team for his own ends. Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at No. 17, Goku, and Vegeta. No. 17 uses a barrier to hold back Jiren's blast and forms force fields around Goku and Vegeta to protect them, before self-destructing to destroy Jiren's blast. Despite his exhausted state, Vegeta faces off against Jiren and declares that he will defeat him. ",2/11/2018,,,5,5
128,Noble Pride to the End! Vegeta Falls!!,30,"Vegeta prepares for a final stand against Jiren. Although Vegeta is too exhausted to turn into even a Super Saiyan, he still decides to take on Jiren. Jiren easily dodges his attacks and continues to pummel Vegeta. Jiren injures Vegeta's left eye in the process. Vegeta is knocked to the brink of elimination, and he begins to think about the people in his life he cares about the most. He gets back up and continues to fight Jiren, who is impressed by Vegeta's pride. Vegeta nearly rings out again. His boot catches onto a floating piece of rubble, which narrowly allows him to stay in the fight because the pieces of rubble still count as part of the fighting stage. Vegeta hears Bulma's voice urging him to fight on, and he returns to fight Jiren once again. Jiren is unable to understand why Vegeta continues to fight him. Vegeta fires off a Final Flash, but Jiren is unfazed. Jiren knocks Vegeta out of the fighting stage and eliminates him from the tournament. Although Vegeta is upset at being unable to last until the end, he gives Goku his remaining energy at the last second before falling out of bounds. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and begins to fight Jiren with his remaining power. Even with Vegeta's energy, Goku is still overwhelmed by Jiren. He is knocked back into his base form. When Goku is pushed back to the edge of the fighting stage and only one punch away from defeat, Vegeta shouts at Goku. Goku thinks about how the others have all put their faith in him. As Jiren delivers the final blow, Goku suddenly reactivates Ultra Instinct and dodges the attack. With his new power, Goku is able to effortlessly dodge Jiren's attacks and lands a heavy blow on him. Both fighters face off and prepare for their final battle. ",2/18/2018,,,5,5
129,Limits Super Surpassed! Ultra Instinct Mastered!!,30,"Whis points out that, since Goku has no allies to help him and no time to recover from the strain caused by Ultra Instinct, this will be his last chance to end the battle. Goku and Jiren resume their battle, but Goku has the same problem he experienced with Kefla, and is unable to attack at his full potential. Goku tries the same trick he used on Kefla by powering up a Kamehameha and firing it at Jiren, but Jiren is able to punch through the blast. Belmod is confident that Goku's incomplete Ultra Instinct will not be enough to win, but Vegeta points out that, throughout the tournament, all of the Saiyans have been able to surpass their limits and achieve higher levels of power. Jiren is able to trap Goku on a single floating rock and fires a barrage of attacks down at him in an attempt to knock him out, but Goku begins blocking Jiren's attacks with his own punches. Jiren launches a final blast down at Goku, but Goku suddenly powers up immensely. He easily blocks Jiren's blast and jumps back up to the fighting stage. Jiren attacks again, but this time Goku easily overpowers him with a flurry of punches. Whis reveals that Goku has completed his ascension. Goku's hair and eyes have turned silver, and he now has full mastery over Ultra Instinct. ",3/4/2018,,,5,5
130,The Greatest Showdown of All Time! The Ultimate Survival Battle!!,30,"Having mastered Ultra Instinct, Goku overpowers and corners Jiren, which forces Jiren to break through his own limits and power up even further. The two exchange attacks continuously. Despite almost being defeated twice, Goku stands up and recovers. When Jiren asks why Goku refuses to surrender, his friends claim that the source of Goku's strength comes from the trust between him and his companions. Refusing to accept it, an enraged Jiren launches an attack on the bleachers that is repelled by a furious Goku, who finally defeats him. However, just as Goku is about to knock Jiren out, his body collapses from the strain of using Ultra Instinct for too long. Jiren takes the opportunity to knock Goku off the fighting stage, but Goku is saved by Frieza. No. 17 is also revealed to have survived Jiren's blast. As Frieza and No. 17 prepare themselves to face Jiren, Goku writhes in pain. ",3/18/2018,,,5,5
131,The Miraculous Conclusion! Farewell Goku! Until We Meet Again!,30,"With Goku down, Frieza and No. 17 face off against Jiren. No. 17 manages to injure Jiren, who collapses from exhaustion. Frieza is about to eliminate Jiren, who accepts his impending defeat, but Toppo calls out to Jiren and inspires him to keep fighting despite his injuries. Jiren powers up and fires a massive blast at Frieza and No. 17. They form a barrier to shield themselves, but Frieza is running low on energy and loses his Golden form. Before Jiren can overpower them, Goku manages to get back up and rejoins the others. Goku adds his strength to the barrier and enables them to block Jiren's blast. Goku and Frieza take on Jiren together, while No. 17 provides cover fire. Working together, Goku and Frieza overpower Jiren and tackle him out of the ring. All three of them are eliminated from the tournament. With all of their fighters gone, Universe 11 is erased. As the only fighter remaining on the fighting stage, No. 17 is declared the winner of the Tournament of Power, and he is given the privilege of getting his wish granted from the Super Dragon Balls. After some consideration, No. 17 wishes to restore all of the universes that had been erased, which brings all their inhabitants back to life. As the erased universes are restored, the Grand Minister reveals that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had foresaw the outcome of a virtuous being winning the Tournament of Power who would make a selfless wish on the Super Dragon Balls. He also stated that they would have otherwise erased the entire multiverse if the winner had wished for selfish reasons, as this would have shown that the winning universe was no better than the erased universes and that the universes excluded from the tournament were not equally worthy of existing. As a reward for doing well in the tournament, Whis restores Frieza to life. In Universe 11, Jiren establishes a real friendship with Toppo and looks forward to having a rematch with Goku someday. The group from Universe 7 return home. Frieza leaves Earth and resumes leadership of his empire. Goku vows to defeat him if he starts causing trouble again. Goku and Vegeta meet for a sparring match in the place where they first fought. Goku reveals that he cannot use Ultra Instinct anymore and believes that he obtained it by accident during the tournament. Goku and Vegeta declare that they will keep finding new levels of strength. They race towards each other to fight. ",3/25/2018,,,5,5

Toppo unleashes his new power, which damages the fighting stage and breaks a large portion of it. No. 17 and Frieza attack Toppo repeatedly, but his power is now far superior to theirs. Toppo easily defeats them both. Fortunately, they are able to stay on the fighting stage, but Toppo knocks Frieza unconscious and engages in another beam clash with No. 17. ",1/28/2018,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZg94z2qNEAadBJhnn-ekPPizL1i-gb9/preview,20,6
126,Surpass Even a God! Vegetas Desperate Blow!!,30,"Toppo easily overpowers No. 17's blast. No. 17 is able to evade him for a while by using the broken fighting stage to his advantage, but Toppo effortlessly withstands No. 17's attacks. Toppo prepares to eliminate No. 17 with a giant energy blast. Frieza rejoins the battle and deflects Toppo's attack. Frieza uses his own energy attack to immobilize Toppo, which allows him and No. 17 to land numerous attacks, but none of them have any effect. Toppo is about to eliminate them both, when he is interrupted by Goku and Vegeta, who are still fighting Jiren. Frieza and No. 17 are hit by one of Jiren's attacks, which gives Toppo the opportunity to attack Vegeta instead. Toppo overwhelms Vegeta with his new power and states that he has cast aside everything else in order to become strong enough to win the tournament. However, Vegeta is inspired by his family, his promise to Cabba, and his Saiyan pride. He refuses to cast anything aside. Vegeta unleashes his full power and overwhelms Toppo. Vegeta and Toppo both use their ultimate attacks: Toppo unleashes his Energy of Destruction, while Vegeta uses the Final Explosion technique that he used against Majin Buu. Vegeta's attack overwhelms Toppo's attack, blasts Toppo out of the fighting stage, and eliminates him from the tournament. This also causes even more damage to the fighting stage. Due to Vegeta being much stronger than the last time he used the Final Explosion technique, he survives the blast, but his energy is almost completely drained. No. 17 also reappears, but he has been injured by Jiren's attack. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all face off against Jiren, who begins to unleash his full power. ",2/4/2018,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgA8Jud5tdwsiHIVdGmO-ROB5gqPn8z5/preview,20,6

However, No. 17 manages to land a sneak attack and injures Jiren. Jiren defeats Goku and Vegeta, while Frieza rejoins the fight and tries to kill Jiren in his golden form. However, Frieza is easily defeated as well. No. 17 asks Jiren what his wish on the Super Dragon Balls would be, and Belmod explains that Jiren's endless pursuit of strength was inspired when his parents, most of his comrades, and mentor were killed by a powerful villain. However, his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship, and he now focuses solely on increasing his own strength. No. 17 admires Jiren's human qualities, but he accuses Jiren of using the rest of his universe's team for his own ends. Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at No. 17, Goku, and Vegeta. No. 17 uses a barrier to hold back Jiren's blast and forms force fields around Goku and Vegeta to protect them, before self-destructing to destroy Jiren's blast.

Vegeta is knocked to the brink of elimination, and he begins to think about the people in his life he cares about the most. He gets back up and continues to fight Jiren, who is impressed by Vegeta's pride. Vegeta nearly rings out again. His boot catches onto a floating piece of rubble, which narrowly allows him to stay in the fight because the pieces of rubble still count as part of the fighting stage. Vegeta hears Bulma's voice urging him to fight on, and he returns to fight Jiren once again. Jiren is unable to understand why Vegeta continues to fight him. Vegeta fires off a Final Flash, but Jiren is unfazed. Jiren knocks Vegeta out of the fighting stage and eliminates him from the tournament. Although Vegeta is upset at being unable to last until the end, he gives Goku his remaining energy at the last second before falling out of bounds.

When Goku is pushed back to the edge of the fighting stage and only one punch away from defeat, Vegeta shouts at Goku. Goku thinks about how the others have all put their faith in him. As Jiren delivers the final blow, Goku suddenly reactivates Ultra Instinct and dodges the attack. With his new power, Goku is able to effortlessly dodge Jiren's attacks and lands a heavy blow on him.

Ultra Instinct Mastered!!,30,"Whis points out that, since Goku has no allies to help him and no time to recover from the strain caused by Ultra Instinct, this will be his last chance to end the battle. Goku and Jiren resume their battle, but Goku has the same problem he experienced with Kefla, and is unable to attack at his full potential. Goku tries the same trick he used on Kefla by powering up a Kamehameha and firing it at Jiren, but Jiren is able to punch through the blast. Belmod is confident that Goku's incomplete Ultra Instinct will not be enough to win, but Vegeta points out that, throughout the tournament, all of the Saiyans have been able to surpass their limits and achieve higher levels of power. Jiren is able to trap Goku on a single floating rock and fires a barrage of attacks down at him in an attempt to knock him out, but Goku begins blocking Jiren's attacks with his own punches. Jiren launches a final blast down at Goku, but Goku suddenly powers up immensely. He easily blocks Jiren's blast and jumps back up to the fighting stage.

The Ultimate Survival Battle!!,30,"Having mastered Ultra Instinct, Goku overpowers and corners Jiren, which forces Jiren to break through his own limits and power up even further. The two exchange attacks continuously. Despite almost being defeated twice, Goku stands up and recovers. When Jiren asks why Goku refuses to surrender, his friends claim that the source of Goku's strength comes from the trust between him and his companions. Refusing to accept it, an enraged Jiren launches an attack on the bleachers that is repelled by a furious Goku, who finally defeats him. However, just as Goku is about to knock Jiren out, his body collapses from the strain of using Ultra Instinct for too long.

Frieza is about to eliminate Jiren, who accepts his impending defeat, but Toppo calls out to Jiren and inspires him to keep fighting despite his injuries. Jiren powers up and fires a massive blast at Frieza and No. 17. They form a barrier to shield themselves, but Frieza is running low on energy and loses his Golden form. Before Jiren can overpower them, Goku manages to get back up and rejoins the others. Goku adds his strength to the barrier and enables them to block Jiren's blast. Goku and Frieza take on Jiren together, while No. 17 provides cover fire. Working together, Goku and Frieza overpower Jiren and tackle him out of the ring. All three of them are eliminated from the tournament. With all of their fighters gone, Universe 11 is erased. As the only fighter remaining on the fighting stage, No. 17 is declared the winner of the Tournament of Power, and he is given the privilege of getting his wish granted from the Super Dragon Balls. After some consideration, No. 17 wishes to restore all of the universes that had been erased, which brings all their inhabitants back to life. As the erased universes are restored, the Grand Minister reveals that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had foresaw the outcome of a virtuous being winning the Tournament of Power who would make a selfless wish on the Super Dragon Balls. He also stated that they would have otherwise erased the entire multiverse if the winner had wished for selfish reasons, as this would have shown that the winning universe was no better than the erased universes and that the universes excluded from the tournament were not equally worthy of existing. As a reward for doing well in the tournament, Whis restores Frieza to life. In Universe 11, Jiren establishes a real friendship with Toppo and looks forward to having a rematch with Goku someday. The group from Universe 7 return home. Frieza leaves Earth and resumes leadership of his empire. Goku vows to defeat him if he starts causing trouble again.

The other strong life form is Goku, who at the Kame House presents his son to Roshi, Krillin, and Bulma.

Ginyu tries again to switch with Vegeta, but Goku, although wounded by Krillin and Gohan attacking his body when it was taken over by Ginyu, throws a Namekian frog in the path, resulting in Ginyu switching into the frog's body. With the Ginyu Force completely defeated, Vegeta places Goku in a rejuvenation chamber inside Frieza's spaceship, and gives battle armor to Krillin and Gohan. Krillin leaves to find the Grand Elder to learn the appropriate summoning ritual for the Namekian Dragon Balls. Krillin meets up with Dende on the way over, as Dende had been heading for the Earth team already. It is revealed that the summoning has to be done in the Namekian language, so Dende will act as the translator to summon the dragon and request the wishes. Meanwhile, Nail continues to fight Frieza to stall for the time needed for Dende to reach Krillin and Gohan. Nail eventually reveals this to Frieza after realizing he will never last if he continues; the enraged tyrant immediately charges back towards his spaceship to try to regain control of the Dragon Balls. Krillin, Gohan, and Dende take advantage of the fact that Vegeta is napping, and take the Dragon Balls away from the ship and successfully summon Porunga, the Eternal Dragon of Namek. ",6-Dec-09,29-Jul-10,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mjH3vaE1VwF73Wtg_f6hH5BCrDha1gjj/preview,41,3

They then use the second wish to teleport Piccolo to Namek so he can assist them in their fight with Frieza, but they are not specific enough in their wish; as a result Piccolo is indeed transported to Namek, but ends up quite a distance away from his friends and the imminent battle with Frieza. At this point Vegeta awakens and learns he's been duped, and speeds angrily to where Porunga is hovering over Namek. He is about to attack Krillin and Gohan until they tell him there is still one wish left; after some debate it is decided to let Vegeta use the wish to become immortal, as it seems to be the only possible way to defeat Frieza. Dende speaks the wish, but just before it can be granted, the Grand Elder dies and the Namekian Dragon Balls become useless; Porunga disintegrates and the balls turn to plain stone. Just as Vegeta thinks his luck couldn't get any worse, Frieza finally arrives, and is not happy at all that his own plans for immortality have been thwarted. ",13-Dec-09,6-Sep-10,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hdEmlQeNcF8YpTFO4IF6RlwzagfHS_Qx/preview,41,3

As Gohan knocks Frieza out of the air, Dende saves Krillin from drowning and heals him - this was one of his hidden powers that the Grand Elder had unlocked. Frieza charges towards Gohan to get his revenge, only to be blasted in the back by Vegeta - which, to the Saiyan prince's disappointment, does absolutely nothing. Frieza begins thrashing Gohan, but is rescued by the healed Krillin, who distracts the tyrant with numerous attacks and escapades - buying just enough time for Dende to heal Gohan. It becomes clear that Frieza outclasses them all, so the three warriors begin blasting him with everything they've got.

Vegeta has realized that each time a Saiyan is badly injured, his power level will increase substantially after he is healed. Vegeta lowers his shields to allow Krillin's attack to succeed, and Krillin proceeds to deliver a devastating blow to Vegeta. What nobody realizes is that Dende has no interest in healing Vegeta; Dende runs from Vegeta and instead heals Piccolo, who eventually convinces him to heal Vegeta as well. Frieza eventually reaches his final form, and immediately kills Dende with his Death Beam technique - having witnessed his healing abilities while transforming, Frieza realizes this may be the key to defeating the others. Krillin, Gohan, and Piccolo go on the attack but the tyrant dodges every single attack they throw his way.

Then, Cell uses his Makankosappo, which Gohan easily deflects, and Cell's Death Beams are absorbed by Gohan. After being easily bested in battle, Cell attempts to destroy Gohan and the Earth with a giant, full-power Kamehameha, but Gohan produces an even stronger wave and reflects Cell's attack with ease. Gohan's attack absorbs Cell's, and the blast eventually overcomes Cell when he fails to deflect it. As the rest of the fighters predict an easy victory, Goku recalls that even in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan displayed strength far beyond that of a normal Super Saiyan, recalling how Gohan had briefly transformed into a Super Saiyan 2 during their training (before passing out). Gohan's attack has also taken off Cell's legs, and parts of his arm and head. Goku then tells Gohan to deliver the finishing blow to Cell, but Gohan insists that Cell must suffer first. Cell regenerated his missing limbs, then utilizes his bulked-up form, but the increase in muscle mass lowers his speed greatly, and as a result none of his attacks connect with Gohan. Gohan counters with a powerful blow to Cell's head, and to his stomach, causing Cell to regurgitate Android #18 and revert to his Semi-Perfect Form.

As Gohan and the rest of the Z Fighters are left on Earth to grieve, Goku and King Kai realize that Cell hasn't accompanied them to the Other World, and therefore must have survived the explosion. Using Goku's Instant Transmission technique, Cell returns to Earth, where he kills Trunks with a single blast through the chest, using his Full Power Death Beam. Cell then reveals that not only did his nucleus survive the explosion, but he was able to regenerate into his Perfect Form - and thanks to his Saiyan genetics, he is far stronger than ever before (Cell's Super Perfect Form).

When Kid Buu was created by Bibidi, the original sorcerer, he was much more dangerous than his later incarnations, and he led Kid Buu to kill the North and West Supreme Kais. Kid Buu absorbed the South Supreme Kai and assumed a hulking form. Kid Buu later absorbed Dai Kaio, which suppressed Kid Buu's focus and destructive impulses. As a result, Kid Buu became the fat Majin Buu that the group first encountered. Back on Earth, Kid Buu creates a powerful ball of energy and throws it at the Earth intent on destroying it. Goku and Vegeta deflect it. In retaliation, Kid Buu creates a ball of energy ten times more powerful than the previous one, and he throws it at the Earth.

The battle is clearly in 17's favor, as Gero and Myuu programmed knowledge of all of Goku's techniques and abilities into him; however, Goku transforms into Super Saiyan 4, which neither Gero or Myuu knew about. He hits 17 with hundreds of energy blasts, but none of them seem to hurt the android. He tries a Kamehameha wave, but 17 makes no effort to get out of the way, and Goku realizes that 17 is absorbing the energy, just like Android 19 did, but without the devices on the hands. Super Android 17 has now absorbed so much energy that he is stronger than Goku. Goku tries to use Instant Transmission to sneak up on 17, but the android can sense where he is going to appear by analyzing the distortion Instant Transmission causes in the atmosphere. With none of Goku's tactics working, Super Android 17 conjures a powerful energy ball to finish him off. ",28-May-97,21-Aug-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLcP30eywSFUMKAd82w8-4uof0M4-PDN/preview,52,4
47,The Greatest Surprise,30,"While 17 is distracted by making his energy ball, Goku sneaks up from behind and grabs him. He tries to blow them both up, but when the smoke clears, both of them remain alive. 17 had put up a shield to protect himself, but it also protected Goku just enough to keep him alive. Once again, he gathers energy for his final attack, but suddenly 18 shows up. Her taunts cause 17 to turn and destroy Dr. Myuu. He turns back to kill Goku, but before he can, 18 starts firing energy blasts at him. While 17 is absorbing the blasts, Goku realizes that he is unable to move while absorbing energy and thus vulnerable, and he quickly attacks, punching a hole through him. He finishes 17 off with a Kamehameha wave. Bulma arrives, saying that the Earth is incredibly unstable because of the interdimensional portals that 17 and Piccolo opened up. They gather the Dragon Balls to fix this, only to find that they are all cracked. When they call Shenron, black smoke issues from them, and a mysterious but powerful, evil new dragon emerges. ",4-Jun-97,28-Aug-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RNd95Twa0c1LwKpkB0d18XJlnxFBMRJk/preview,52,4
48,The Shadow Dragons,30,"The new dragon turns out to be pure evil. He sucks up the Dragon Balls and then splits into seven more dragons, which then fly away. Elder Kai explains that each time the Dragon Balls are used, they store negative energy, and that energy takes 100 years to dissipate. The reason the balls scatter after they're used is to give them time to release their negative energy. But because Bulma invented the dragon radar, they were able to find them very quickly and summon Shenron many times. This overuse caused the balls to overload themselves with negative energy, and that energy spawned the Shadow Dragons. All those present blame Bulma for this, but she quickly places the blame on Goku, stating that she could never have found them without his help. In any event, Goku, feeling guilty for having used the Dragon Balls so often, goes off to slay the dragons, as they will potentially destroy the universe if left unchecked. Goku follows the destructive path left by the dragons, and Pan follows him, bringing Giru along to use the dragon radar. They find the two-star dragon destroying a village. ",11-Jun-97,4-Sep-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gKc6ViUm-mUW8UKKJR4xkhKkcQxRB_FN/preview,53,4
49,The Two-Star Dragon,30,"The two-star dragon, Haze Shenron, is severely polluting the entire area, so Pan steps in to stop him. She is much more powerful than the dragon and relentlessly beats it up. But Pan's attacks seem to do less and less, until the dragon is able to overpower her. Goku tries to transform into a Super Saiyan and finds that he is unable to. The dragon explains that his pollution causes all living things to exponentially weaken, die and decay over a short period of time. This is why Pan's strength is gone, and why Goku can't power up. He also reveals that he was created when Goku wished to revive Bora, father of his old friend Upa, after he was killed by Mercenary Tao, horrifying Goku with the fact that he was indeed responsible for the creation of the Shadow Dragons. The dragon beats them up, and then throws them into the lake. Giru, who is unaffected by the poison due to being a robot, goes underwater and pulls them to an uninfected part of the lake. There is a spring here that is feeding in pure water from underground, keeping the area clean. Goku blasts the hole, flooding the lake with clean water. With their powers rejuvenated, Goku and Pan destroy the dragon quickly before his pollution has enough time to take effect and recover the two-star ball, which returns to its original form. ",18-Jun-97,11-Sep-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdI0hlbTCxew8CfdbG6kCBNzez6zmjzl/preview,53,4
50,The Five-Star Dragon,30,"Goku, Pan, and Giru go to a nearby city to get something to drink but they find that all its inhabitants are nowhere to be seen. They find some weird electric slime, and they figure out that the five-star dragon, Rage Shenron, is controlling the slime. After revealing that he was created when Master Roshi and Bulma wished to revive Goku when Vegeta and Nappa originally came to Earth, he gathers the slime and becomes gigantic. Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan 4 and tries to blast the dragon, but the slime bounces his attack back at him. The dragon traps Goku and Pan in the slime, which begins to electrocute them. It begins to rain, causing the dragon to short circuit and explode. Rage Shenron tricks Pan by admitting defeat and when she tries to claim the Dragon Ball, Rage Shenron tries to trap her but she gets out of the way. Goku then destroys him by using a normal Kamehameha Wave. Goku and Pan claim the five-star ball. ",25-Jun-97,23-Oct-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GFGBrc_ZGAiojq55HxvdDIL1FCgq54Bn/preview,53,4
51,The Six-Star Dragon,30,"Goku, Pan, and Giru find the six-star dragon, Oceanus Shenron, in a fishing village. She reveals that she was created by the very first wish that Goku and company ever made (Oolong wishing for a pair of underwear in order to thwart Emperor Pilaf); while both she and Pan are disgusted and embarrassed by this, Goku looks back on it with humor, much to the dragon's anger. This dragon can put up energy shields, so Goku can't hit her. He tries to use a Kamehameha wave, but the dragon deflects it. The dragon then creates an extremely powerful vortex, smashing Goku through a cliff. Pan creates her first Kamehameha wave and blasts it at the dragon, which gives Goku the chance to deal the finishing blow. They collect the six-star ball and continue their journey. ",2-Jul-97,30-Oct-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1swLCtZsi6fGH-4pIaTv1MmfxiywC0RXu/preview,53,4
52,The Seven-Star Dragon,30,"Goku, Pan, and Giru locate the seven-star dragon, Naturon Shenron. He is creating earthquakes by digging holes in the ground, and he isn't interested in fighting. Goku and Pan follow him while he's digging, and see that he's headed for a city. The dragon creates a massive earthquake, but Pan and Goku as a Super Saiyan 4, are able to prevent the city from being damaged. The dragon gets angry with them and after revealing that he was created by the wish to revive all innocents killed by Majin Vegeta on the day of Majin Buu's resurrection, tries to fight, but ends up hitting himself with his own attack. Goku prepares to deal the final blow, but the dragon dies on its own. Goku powers down and Pan catches the seven-star ball, only to find that it still has cracks in it. The ball begins to glow, and Pan gets sucked into it. The dragon reveals that he uses a hosts body to form his own. He was using a mole's body, which is why he was so weak, but now he is using Pan's body, which means he is far more powerful. He wants to get Goku's Super Saiyan 4 body, but Goku refuses to power up. He says that he'll fight if the dragon releases Pan. ",2-Jul-97,30-Oct-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yQdsOLLUXrm6yhdscqTM3GVtlsvB0GBt/preview,53,4
53,Saying Goodbye,30,"The seven-star dragon begins destroying the city. Inside of him, Pan can't take the destruction, so she telepathically pleads with Goku to fight. He realizes that it's the right thing to do, so he reluctantly transforms into a Super Saiyan 4. Intending to kill the dragon, along with Pan, he hits the dragon with a Kamehameha wave. The dust clears, and the dragon is still alive. Goku couldn't bring himself to put all of the necessary energy into the blast. The dragon turns the tide of the fight, and appears to knock Goku out. He mockingly ""grants Goku's wish"" by letting him see Pan one last time. He pushes Pan halfway out of him, and Goku grabs her and pulls her out. The dragon regresses to his normal form, and Goku destroys him. They claim the seven-star ball, and continue their journey. ",16-Jul-97,13-Nov-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/16b-MRd3QWGdjYNRhGFDsqUWOK-Jgk9N7/preview,53,4

He can raise his body temperature to even greater levels than the surface of the sun, which makes punching him out of the question. Goku is forced to run from the dragon. He realizes that he can still use energy waves, so he begins attacking the dragon. After a while, the dragon gets tired of playing around, and he changes into his final form. Goku follows suit, and transforms into a Super Saiyan 4. ",6-Aug-97,20-Nov-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VOm7czZFTf_YoO8hgvNhoqT2xI17wF2M/preview,53,4
55,The Heart of the Prince,30,"Vegeta tries to leave for the fight to join Goku and the others, but Bulma convinces him to stay. She says that she's working on something that will help him. While she's preparing the device, Vegeta reminisces about Goku in the past; everything from their first fight when he was once evil (though he was still good in the present), to Goku's fight with Frieza when he first transformed into a Super Saiyan, to their fight when he was Majin Vegeta (half evil, half good), to their fight with Kid Buu. Bulma then explains how Goku became Super Saiyan 4 in the fight against Baby on the Tuffle planet: when Goku looked at the Earth from the Tuffle planet as if it were a full moon, he transformed into a Golden Great Ape because the Blutz Waves he absorbed were naturally being created by the Earth, in the same way as if they only reflect from the moon. Pan helped him become conscious of himself, and this made him transform again into the final Super Saiyan 4 stage. Since Vegeta is already conscious of himself as a regular Great Ape, theoretically he just needs to be bombarded with Blutz Waves to make the transformation to Super Saiyan Great Ape and then he can become a Super Saiyan 4. Bulma hypothesizes that Vegeta didn't transform into a Super Saiyan 4 while Baby was possessing him as a Super Saiyan Great Ape because Vegeta wasn't conscious. To create these Blutz Waves, Bulma has built a mobile version of the machine that she built for Baby on the Tuffle planet while she was possessed by one of Baby's parasitic offspring. ",13-Aug-97,27-Nov-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b2P1HPy2TZj17D7qxq1I7qHnzbZ8KeDQ/preview,53,4
56,The Three-Star Dragon,30,"Goku and Nuova, the four-star dragon, begin to fight in earnest. Goku catches Nuova off guard, but grants him a freebie because Nuova spared Pan's life at Goku's request when he could have easily destroyed her. Nuova says that he doesn't harm innocent and helpless people. As they continue to fight, a beam comes out of nowhere and hits Goku's arm, freezing it. It came from Eis Shenron, the three-star dragon, and Nuova's twin brother, who was (as revealed in Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files) brought forth by the wish that erased the memories of Majin Buu from everyone on Earth excluding the Z Fighters and their friends. Eis has taken the Dragon Balls from Pan, and he gives them to Nuova. He then freezes the rest of Goku. Eis commands Nova to finish Goku off, but Nuova refuses because Goku can't defend himself. Eis beats up Nuova, and reissues his command. Nuova appears to obey, but his attack just melts the ice. Goku thanks Nuova, and promises to beat Eis in ten seconds. ",20-Aug-97,4-Dec-04,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yZu782JUQqkySopnvutTEq8-6N2rKCw_/preview,53,4
57,The One-Star Dragon,30,"Goku and Eis begin to fight. When the battle is in Goku's favor, Eis resorts to dirty tricks, such as using the unconscious Pan and even his own brother as human shields. Eis freezes him again, but Goku is able to break free, and he beats the dragon. As Eis is begging for mercy, he suddenly slashes Goku's eyes, blinding him. Goku is able to quickly land a devastating punch, which finishes off the three-star dragon. Nuova hands Goku special eye drops to cure his blindness, but they are shot out of his hand. It was the one-star dragon, Syn Shenron, who was created (also revealed in Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files) by the wish that revived all victims of Frieza and his men. He quickly destroys Nuova, leaving only a blind Goku to fight him. An enraged and disgusted Goku criticizes him for killing one of his own kind, but Syn merely reminds him that Goku is responsible for the birth of all Shadow Dragons because he overused the Dragon Balls. Undaunted, Goku states that he always used the Dragon Balls for the good of the Earth and never used them selfishly even once, and tries to fight, but even when he lands a Kamehameha wave, he isn't able to do any damage to the one-star dragon. The dragon lands a powerful hit, which knocks Goku unconscious.

While Majuub tries to hold off the dragon, Gohan, Goten, and Trunks give all of their power to Goku. Goku absorbs more power than even he thought possible, and even though he's still blind, he can perfectly sense the one-star dragon's movements. The dragon can't even land a punch. Goku fires a Kamehameha wave at the dragon, seemingly killing him. The dragon reappears, having dodged the blast.

Omega Shenron retaliates by using the powers of the four, three, six, and five star dragons. At this point, Goku, whose vision has been restored, blasts a Kamehameha at Omega Shenron, who was taken by surprise, and seemingly destroys him with a Dragon Fist. However, he regenerates back to normal using the power of the five star dragon. Omega Shenron's power has far surpassed Goku's. Goku is no longer a match for him. Desperate, Goku grabs Omega Shenron. He begins to self-destruct, but Vegeta arrives and tells him not to. He knows firsthand that self-destruction doesn't work. Bulma arrives with the Blutz Wave Generator, and she blasts Vegeta with it. Vegeta transforms into a Great Ape, and it seems like he has lost control of himself, but he quickly becomes conscious of his actions. He then transforms into a Golden Great Ape and finally Super Saiyan 4, but even teaming up with Goku won't be enough to stop Omega Shenron.

While they hold Omega Shenron off, Goku and Vegeta fuse. They are now Gogeta, and are far more powerful than Omega Shenron. His punches are too fast even for the dragon to see. But instead of quickly finishing the job, Gogeta toys with Omega Shenron. Furious, the dragon unleashes all of the Dragon Balls' negative energy in one massive attack. Gogeta redirects the ball easily away from the Earth, and the negative energy that was enveloping the Earth dissipates. Gogeta then hits Omega Shenron with a Big Bang Kamehameha x100, but it doesn't quite kill him. Before Gogeta can finish him off, he splits in two again, their immense power having cut the normal fusion time in half.

He's too fast and powerful to avoid long enough to fuse. Then Goku and Vegeta use the after-image technique, which distracts Omega Shenron long enough for them to do the fusion dance. However, the dance doesn't work for some reason. Knowing that it won't work again, Omega Shenron lets them try one more time. This time, Goku reverts to his child self. Because he's been fighting longer than Vegeta, he is out of power, and therefore can't fuse.

Goku creates a Kamehameha wave, and both he and Nuova turn and fire at Omega Shenron. After being infected with Omega's negative energy, Nuova was flooded with positive energy while inside Goku. Nuova then grabs Omega and encases the two of them in flames. The ball of fire erupts, and it seems that Omega has been destroyed. But when the smoke clears, only Omega is left. Right before the explosion, Omega took cover inside of Nuova's heat-resistant body. Now Omega Shenron is at full power because he has all seven Dragon Balls inside him. To make matters even worse, Vegeta loses power, including Super Saiyan 4 as well, and reverts back to his base state, and is unable to power up, since the Blutz Wave Generator was destroyed by Omega Shenron. ",5-Nov-97,15-Jan-05,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVjWanBOjwIHFgnrcPgoSf1evHSLxAZF/preview,53,4

Omega then once again floods the Earth with negative energy, and Vegeta, seeking to avenge Goku's apparent death, charges, only to be defeated quickly. Before losing consciousness, Vegeta assures him that he hasn't won yet, which proves true as a still-living Goku rises from the crater, holding a Spirit Bomb. He has gathered all the energy from the Earth, but it's not enough. He tells King Kai to ask the entire universe for power. During this time, Omega repeatedly blasts Goku, but cannot damage him, due to the immense amount of energy that Goku is now in possession of. Energy from all over the universe gathers on Earth, and the phenomenally powerful Universal Spirit Bomb is completed. Omega, now fearing for his life, swallows his pride and pleads for mercy, but Goku refuses to listen and hits him with the Spirit Bomb, destroying him.

However, he allows one more wish at Goku's request, which is to repair all damage done to the Earth since the gateway to Hell was opened up by Android 17, as well as revive all the innocent people who have been killed. Just before Shenron leaves, he calls for Goku to accompany him. Goku entrusts Vegeta to take his place as Earth's savior, and as they fly away, Bulma reminisces about her time with Goku.
